php composer.phar update
php app/console assetic:dump
php app/console assets:install web --symlink
php app/console server:run
```

## Usage

Just browse website and look at the corresponding controllers/views to know how to implement them.

Menus refer to controllers with the same name, for example:
- Basic usage is associated with BasicController and Basic/basic.html.twig
